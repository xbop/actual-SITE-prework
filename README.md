**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Imani Musembi**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/curly-probable-mochi)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
n/a

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I've worked with HTML and CSS before, but I haven't had a lot of experience with java. I currently use python in my computational course on campus so the syntax is different. A big thing for me that I struggled with is distinguishing between what functions apply to all buttons and what functions only apply to select functions. Much like in python, there are certain characteristics or variables that are only applicable to certain functions while other variables remain constant or globally applicable. Although I was able to follow along with the tutorial and format my code in the way that was intended, I wished I was able to understand what specific aspects or commands are responsible for differentiating between specific aspects of code and more generalized aspects of code. Upon further reflection and review of certain lines, I knew which function was responsible for what aspects of the game. However, I still hope to gain a better understanding as to why they work rather than just simple identification.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would like to know more about the different uses for css formatting. When using python, you just see a bunch of lines of code. However, I love the creative freedom and liberty that stems from the usage of css files in order to make the program appeal to the user. The reason I added a minor in applied analytics is because I wanted to dive deeper into how to make content engaging and appealing to a certain demographic. Visualization is a really important aspect of that which has been very apparent in the industry. I want to learn how to better integrate stylistic elements in order to make the program stand out to the user.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
One thing I really liked about the pitch of the buttons is that they almost resembled that of a song. One thing I would've loved to do had I been given a few more hours would be to play around with the pitch so that, rather than a random pattern and assortment of sounds playing, the user would actually be tasked with creating a song by accurately inputting the correct sequence of buttons. I feel like this would also make the experience more engaging by adding an additional goal in addition to simply testing one's memory. Furthermore, in order to expand on the engagement aspect, users can play around with the buttons and create their own sequence of sounds imitating that of music for other users to then try and replicate.
