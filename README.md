2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I've worked with HTML and CSS before, but I haven't had a lot of experience with java. I currently use python in my computational course on campus so the syntax is different. A big thing for me that I struggled with is distinguishing between what functions apply to all buttons and what functions only apply to select functions. Much like in python, there are certain characteristics or variables that are only applicable to certain functions while other variables remain constant or globally applicable. Although I was able to follow along with the tutorial and format my code in the way that was intended, I wish I was able to understand what specific aspects or commands are responsible for differe
